# LTMapper

Custom ORM for Ruby

This project was a learning exercise to better understand the finer points of ActiveRecord. It implements many of the core functions of ActiveRecord using Ruby's metaprogramming. Features include:

- Models
- Queries (```.find```, ```.all```, ```.where```, ```.save```, ```.update```)
- Associations (```belongs_to```, ```has_many```, ```has_one_through```)
